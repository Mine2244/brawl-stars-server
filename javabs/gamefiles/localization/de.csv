TID_HINT_4,"Du kannst einen vorbereiteten Schuss abbrechen, indem du den Joystick zurück in die Mitte bewegst."
TID_HINT_5,"Das Matchmaking richtet sich nach der Trophäenanzahl des Brawlers, mit dem du spielst. Dadurch ist es leichter, mit einem neu freigeschalteten Brawler Trophäen zu sammeln."
TID_HINT_6,"Indem du mehr Brawler freischaltest, wird es einfacher, deine Gesamttrophäen zu erhöhen und dir mehr Belohnungen zu sichern."
TID_HINT_7,"Je weiter Pipers Schüsse fliegen, desto mehr Schaden richten sie an."

TID_HINT_16,AUTOMATISCHES SCHIESSEN feuert eine Attacke in einer geraden Linie und berechnet nicht die Bewegungen des Gegners mit ein.
